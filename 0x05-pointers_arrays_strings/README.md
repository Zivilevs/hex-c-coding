# Pointers and arrays

### Code exercises :computer: :

0. Function that takes a pointer to an int as parameter and updates the value it points to to 98.
1. Function that swaps the values of two integers.
2. Write a function that returns the length of a string.  
   - The standard library provides a similar function: `strlen` )
3. Function that prints a string, followed by a new line to stdout. ( recreate `puts`)
4. Function that prints a string, in reverse, followed by a new line.
5. Function that reverses a string.
6. Function that prints every other character of a string, starting with the first character, followed by a new line.
7. Function that prints half of a string, followed by a new line.
8. Function that prints n elements of an array of integers, followed by a new line  (allowed to use `printf`this time).
9. Function that copies the string pointed to by `src`, including the terminating null byte (`\0`), to the buffer pointed to by `dest`. (The standard library provides a similar function: `strcpy`. )
   1. using `for `loop
   2. using `do while`loop
10. Function that convert a string to an integer. #bonus #advanced
